Checkd.in User Bridge Rails template
==========================

This template provides the basics needed to get started working with the Checkd.in API. Simply add the following values to config/checkdin_config.yml to get started:

* client_identifier
* client_secret
* shared\_authentication_secret
* api_url (staging)
* checkdin\_landing_url (staging)
* checkdin\_landing_url (production)
* campaign_id (staging)
* campaign_id (production)

Once added, a user will be able to authenticate through Checkd.in's User Bridge using either Facebook or email signup.

This template provides only the basics necessary to get started. Adapt it to your own Authentication system, or build on the basic system provided.
